- standalone plugins for effects:
	- BeepBox Distortion (M)
	- BeepBox Bitcrusher (M)
	- BeepBox Chorus
	- BeepBox Echo
	- BeepBox Reverb
	- BeepBox Compressor/Limiter

	- BeepBox Stereo Distortion

	or, perhaps:
	- "BeepBox Mono Effects", which includes:
		- distortion, bitcrusher
	- "BeepBox Stereo Effects", which includes:
		- chorus, echo, reverb, limiter
		- and mono effects applied individually per channel

BUGS:
- vibrato starts from wrong beat in fl studio. Could either clap-wrapper not
  providing playback information (not likely) or my code being faulty. need to
  check with bitwig studio.
  (...does it? )
