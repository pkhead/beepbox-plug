- vibrato starts from wrong beat in fl studio. Could either clap-wrapper not
  providing playback information (not likely) or my code being faulty. need to
  check with bitwig studio.
- implement strum chord type
- explicitly-named note size, instead of calling it "mod wheel" or whatever.
- now that a note length can be assigned to each note:
	- implement negative fade-out correctly
- add a way for the user to notify the synth of a "next note"
  per voice. that way, the slide transition will work as it does in BeepBox,
  where the seam between the note is the halfway point of the slide transition.





STRUM:
	on tick start:
		choke every released note in a chord that is still active.
		
		when triggered, each voice (but the base) will not be computed, until
		it is determined (using the voice index + strum speed setting [which is
		a feature specific to this mod because idk why no mods have this]) that
		the voice should finally be activated. Voice still needs to exist
		upfront since polyphonic modulation needs something to write to. plus i
		want the last sent modulation value to have an effect.
		
		(it will refer to beat start property of the voice index 0 of that
		chord)
	
CUSTOM INTERVAL:
	in all my years of beepboxing i honestly have no idea what this does.
	i've never used it nor have i seen anyone that have.
	But i do know it makes the instrument monophonic so i'll probably share code
	because with the "monophonic"izer of the arpeggio chord type.
