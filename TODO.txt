- vibrato starts from wrong beat in fl studio. Could either clap-wrapper not
  providing playback information (not likely) or my code being faulty. need to
  check with bitwig studio.
- implement custom interval chord type
- explicitly-named note size, instead of calling it "mod wheel" or whatever.
- now that a note length can be assigned to each note:
	- implement negative fade-out correctly
- add a way for the user to notify the synth of a "next note"
  per voice. that way, the slide transition will work as it does in BeepBox,
  where the seam between the note is the halfway point of the slide transition.
- standalone plugins for effects:
	- BeepBox Distortion (M)
	- BeepBox Bitcrusher (M)
	- BeepBox Chorus (M)
	- BeepBox Echo (S)
	- BeepBox Reverb (S)

	or, perhaps:
	- "BeepBox Mono Effects", which includes:
		- distortion, bitcrusher, chorus
	- "BeepBox Stereo Effects", which includes:
		- echo, reverb
		- and mono effects applied individually per channel

ACCURACY:
	- why doesn't this happen?

STRUM:
	on tick start:
		choke every released note in a chord that is still active.
		
		when triggered, each voice (but the base) will not be computed, until
		it is determined (using the voice index + strum speed setting [which is
		a feature specific to this mod because idk why no mods have this]) that
		the voice should finally be activated. Voice still needs to exist
		upfront since polyphonic modulation needs something to write to. plus i
		want the last sent modulation value to have an effect.
		
		(it will refer to beat start property of the voice index 0 of that
		chord)
	
CUSTOM INTERVAL:
	in all my years of beepboxing i honestly have no idea what this does.
	i've never used it nor have i seen anyone that have.
	But i do know it makes the instrument monophonic so i'll probably share code
	because with the "monophonic"izer of the arpeggio chord type.
